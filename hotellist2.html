                    of the mountain. Among the facilities of this property are a restaurant, a 24-hour front desk and

                    car hire for guests who want to explore the surrounding area. After a lot of disappointing hotels, I
                    appreciated that what you see is exactly what you get. The star attraction is the balcony view with
                    chairs. Staff was also friendly and helped book a taxi to the airport.
